Assignment - Akron Zoo:
Due Date: Sep. 10th, 2025
The business problem is to identify the features of the membership program and customer
characteristics, or combination thereof, that are explainable and reliable predictors of a customer
to upgrade their membership at the time of the annual renewal.
The Akron Zoo society has compiled a dataset of its customers including their
evaluation/use of membership, demographic characteristics, and the upgrade decision (yes/no).
During the program, you learn several predictive/classification models that vary in terms
of the bias-variance tradeoffs they involve, and the statistical approach they are based on. You
are also knowledgeable about different ways of (a) validating and evaluating a predictive model,
(b) checking for sensitivity and robustness, (using multiple model selection criteria, and (d)
interpreting the model parameter estimates to provide insights for solving the business program.
Some of the models you are familiar with include Logistic/Regularized, SVM, Naïve
Bayes, Random Forest, and GBM.
Your goal is to use these models to (a) predict a customer’s probability of upgrading (b)
identify features or combinations thereof that are managerially useful to enhance (increase) this
probability, (c) quantify the predictive effect of these identified feature(s) and (d) explain the
insight (counter-intuitive) that your results uncover.
Compare the different models on the above 4 dimensions and recommend the “best”
model that meets the criteria of robustness, minimum bias and high accuracy. Explain your
reasoning.
Finally, thoroughly explain and interpret the recommended “best” model in solving the
business problem in a way that builds competitive advantage.
You are given two datasets: training and test data with identical features as per
description below.
Each assignment requires 3 parts to completed and submitted:
1. Fully annotated python code-book (60% grade) that addresses and solves the analytics
problem to the best of your knowledge and effort. Annotation is an explainable code that
explains the statistical reasoning for the key steps in the code.
2. Presentation slides (40% grade) no more than 12 (widescreen) that present your project as
if you were delivering your work to a senior manager responsible for the business problem.
Assume that the manager is statistically knowledgeable to understand the analytics but
7
needs detail to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of your work. The manager’s key
focus is on the insights your analysis reveal for solving the business problem.
3. Analytics Pipeline: Develop and provide the analytics plan for solving the business
problem that guided your work as per #1 above.
